Full documentation

make_pelican-v*: this script allows you to make a custom version
of the PelicanHPC live CD/USB image for creation of high performance
computing clusters.

v2.3 and above is amd64 only, use v2.2+eps if you need a 32 bit version. You 
can also make your own 32 bit version quite easily using make_pelican-v*

See http://pelicanhpc.org for more information.

Setup
=====

Requirements
------------

You need to install live-build, debootstrap and rsync to use
it. These packages are installed on PelicanHPC released images, so you can use
this script on PelicanHPC. It can be used on any other GNU/Linux distro as long
as these packages are installed.

ISO generation procedure
------------------------

There is not automated setup procedure. You have to do the following :

1. Download the script make_pelican-v* (see above) and extract them somewhere.

2. Assume you have extracted them into ``**PATH**/``. Run the commands:

        cd **PATH**/
        sudo ./make_pelican-v*

3. The script uses Internet to download splash image and pelicanhome archive, if
you don't have access to Internet, you can download them manually and put them
beside make_pelican-v* script:

    * http://pelicanhpc.awict.net/download/splash.png
    * http://pelicanhpc.awict.net/download/pelicanhome-v4.1.tar.bz2

Don't forgot to to replace **PATH** with your path, and make_pelican-v* with the correct version.
