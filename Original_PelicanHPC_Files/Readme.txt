The files in this folder were downloaded from the PelicanHPC project website in approximately 2017.  
They are included here as a reference, and as a starting point to jump off from. 

Since the website appears to be offline, (as of now, May 2022) I thought it would be good to include them here. 

The files do appear to be availble on sourceforge, and another mirror (see the README in the compressed "make_pelican-v4.1.tar.bz2" for links)
