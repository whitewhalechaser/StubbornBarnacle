To try out hpl on PelicanHPC:

1) you need to compile the xhpl benchmark. To do this, open a terminal in
this directory and type "sh SetupForPelican"

2) once it's compiled, go to ./bin/Pelican and type
"orterun --hostfile /home/user/tmp/bhosts -np 4 xhpl"

This assumes you have already set up the cluster. If not, just
omit the --hostfile /home... switch, and it will run on the 
frontend only.

To get good performance, you need to edit the file ./bin/Pelican/HPL.dat
to provide reasonable values for the inputs. I suggest something like
P=1
Q=3
Ns=2000 or more depending on RAM
NBs=100
