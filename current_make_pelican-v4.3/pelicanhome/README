For clusters that mix machines with different CPUs or different numbers of cores,
you need to edit the file /home/user/tmp/bhosts to load balance your cluster, and
you need to know how to use mpirun properly. Please learn how to do this before 
reporting that your cluster doesn't work properly.

To get started with a simple MPI application, flops.f is provided.
This first appeared at http://cluster.linux-ekb.info/QuickStart1.php which
is an introduction to PelicanHPC, in Russian. It has now been GPL'ed (thanks).

To use it, do something like

mpif77 -o flops flops.f
mpirun -np X --hostfile /home/user/tmp/bhosts flops

where X is the number of MPI ranks you want to use. If you edit the bhosts
file correctly, and choose X correctly, you should see a rough indication
of what your cluster can do.
