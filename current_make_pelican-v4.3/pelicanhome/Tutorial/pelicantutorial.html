is a rapid (~5 minutes, when you know what you're doing) means of
setting up a &quot;high performance computing&quot; (HPC) cluster for
parallel computing using MPI. This tutorial gives a basic description
of what PelicanHPC does, addresses how to use the released CD images
to set up a HPC cluster, and gives some basic examples of usage.</P>
<P>Note: This tutorial uses the term &quot;USB/USB flash&quot;
alongside USB stick, USB drive, USB device, USB pendrive and thumb
drive.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Description of PelicanHPC</H3>
<P>PelicanHPC is a distribution of GNU/Linux that runs as a &quot;live
CD&quot; or bootable USB image&nbsp; (it can also be booted from a
hard disk partition, or it can be used as a virtualized OS). If the
ISO image file is put on a CD or USB, it can then be used to boot a
computer. The computer on which PelicanHPC is booted is referred to
as the &quot;frontend node&quot;. It is the computer with which the
user interacts. Once PelicanHPC is running, a script -&nbsp;
&quot;pelican_setup&quot; - may be run. This script configures the
frontend node as a netboot server. After this has been done, other
computers can boot copies of PelicanHPC over the network. These other
computers are referred to as &quot;compute nodes&quot;. PelicanHPC
configures the cluster made up of the frontend node and the compute
nodes so that MPI-based parallel computing may be done.<BR><BR>A
&quot;live CD&quot; such as PelicanHPC by default does not use the
hard disks of any of the nodes (except Linux swap space, if it
exists), so it will not destroy or alter your installed operating
system. When the PelicanHPC cluster is shut down, all of the
computers are in their original state, and will boot back into
whatever operating systems are installed on them. PelicanHPC <I>can</I>
optionally be made to use hard disk storage, so that its state can be
preserved across boots. It can be configured to boot without user
intervention, with access possible by ssh. There is also the
possibility of making the compute nodes boot using wake-on-LAN. With
these more advanced optional features, PelicanHPC can be used to run
a headless permanent cluster.<BR><BR>PelicanHPC is made using <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian
GNU/Linux</A> as its base, through the <A HREF="http://live.debian.net/">Debian
Live</A> system. It is made by running a single script using the
command &quot;<FONT FACE="monospace">sh make_pelican-v*</FONT>&quot;.
Customized versions of PelicanHPC, for example, containing additional
packages, can easily be made by modifying the make_pelican script.
The make_pelican script and the needed packages are provided on
PelicanHPC, so you can build a custom image using the provided
images. You can also run make_pelican from any GNU/Linux distro if
you install live-build and a few other packages.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Features</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The frontend node can be a real
	computer booted using a CD or a USB device, or a virtual machine
	that is booted using the CD image file. With this last option,
	PelicanHPC can be used at the same time as the normal work
	environment, which may be any of the common operating systems. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The compute nodes are normally
	real computers, for maximum performance, but they can also be
	virtual. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Supports MPI-based parallel
	computing using Fortran (77, 90), C, C++, GNU Octave and Python. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Offers the <A HREF="http://www.open-mpi.org/">Open
	MPI</A> implementation of MPI. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Cluster can be resized to add or
	remove nodes using the &quot;pelican_restarthpc&quot; command. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Easily extensible to add packages.
	Also easily modifiable, since the PelicanHPC CD/USB image is created
	using a single script that relies on the <A HREF="http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/">Debian
	Live</A> system. For this reason, the distributed version is fairly
	basic and lightweight. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Contains example software: <A HREF="http://top500.org/project/linpack">Linpack
	HPL</A> (now at v2.1) benchmark. Also has <A HREF="http://mpi4py.scipy.org/">mpi4py</A>.</P>
</UL>
<H4 CLASS="western">Limitations and requirements</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The compute nodes must be booted
	over the network. This is an option offered by&nbsp; all modern
	networking devices supplied with motherboards, but it often must be
	enabled in the BIOS setup. Enable it, and give it higher priority
	that booting from hard disk or other sources. If you have a network
	card that won't do netboot, it is possible to work around this using
	<A HREF="http://www.rom-o-matic.net/">rom-o-matic</A>. Another thing
	to be aware of is that the PelicanHPC frontend operates as a dhcp
	server. You should not use it on an open network, or you will cause
	dhcp conflicts. This will get you into a world of trouble with the
	network administrators. Plus, your compute nodes will not boot
	properly.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A PelicanHPC cluster is designed
	to be used by a single person - there is only one user, with the
	username &quot;user&quot;. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Released versions are for 64 bit
	CPUs only (Opteron, Turion, Core 2, etc.). make_pelican can easily
	be used to make a 32 bit version, if needed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The PelicanHPC web page lists some other similar distros that
	may be more appropriate for certain uses.</P>
</UL>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Put PelicanHPC onto USB flash or burn it to CD !"></A>
Put PelicanHPC onto USB flash or burn it to CD !</H2>
<P>The most common USB ports and USB flash drives work according to
the USB 2 standard. Booting from USB 2 from a live drive is faster
than from a corresponding CD/DVD disk. Standard USB 2 flash drives
have rather slow flash hardware, with read and write speed much
slower than the transfer speed of USB 2, so it is worth checking if
the speed is specified.</P>
<P>USB 1.1 is also possible to use, but it is very slow, slower than
a corresponding CD/DVD disk.</P>
<P>Hardware according to the USB 3 standard is much faster than USB
2. So if you have a USB 3 port and a USB 3 flash drive, booting and
running will be as fast as from an internal drive (SATA or IDE) or an
external eSATA drive. And a USB 3 flash drive has much faster flash
hardware, and it is usually specified. The market changes quickly, so
it is worth checking on the internet, which brand and model to select
to get the best buy 'today'.</P>
<P>USB 3 flash drives are much faster than USB 2 flash drives also in
USB 2 ports, because the flash hardware is not limiting the transfer
speed. For the same reason a USB connected HDD is also much faster
than a USB 2 flash drive.</P>
<P>It is preferable to use USB 2 or higher. However, if you choose to
use a DVD, burn the downloaded PelicanHPC iso using your favored
software, else if you choose to use a USB flash, follow these steps:</P>
<P>1) Backup your data from USB flash (all data will be lost).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2) Find the device name of USB drive;
before connecting the USB flash, run the command &quot;ls /dev/sd*&quot;
in a terminal, then connect the USB flash and repeat the command &quot;ls
/dev/sd*&quot;, your USB flash is the new name which appear in the
second command.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Exemple from my computer:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a) Before connecting the USB flash:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">user@lep1:~$ ls
/dev/sd*</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">/dev/sda
/dev/sda2 /dev/sda4 /dev/sda6 /dev/sdb</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">/dev/sda1
/dev/sda3 /dev/sda5 /dev/sda7 /dev/sdb1</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b) After connecting the USB flash:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">user@lep1:~$ ls
/dev/sd*</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">/dev/sda
/dev/sda2 /dev/sda4 /dev/sda6 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">/dev/sda1
/dev/sda3 /dev/sda5 /dev/sda7 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">So, the new items are (/dev/sdc and
/dev/sdc1), sdc1 is a partition, sdc is the name of USB drive
(partitions are named by adding a number to the device name: sdc1
first partition, sdc2 second partition, ‚Ä¶).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">3) Put PelicanHPC iso onto USB flash
using the following commands with root permissions:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">sudo cp
path_to_pelicanhpc_iso/pelicanhpc-v3.1-xfce.iso /dev/sdc</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">sudo sync</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Initial setup"></A>Initial setup</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The two main commands for
administration of the cluster are &quot;pelican_setup&quot;, to
configure the frontend as a server, NFS export /home, etc., and
&quot;pelican_restarthpc&quot;, which is used to add/remove nodes
after the initial setup. The rest of this explains how this
works.<BR><BR>The frontend and all compute nodes must be networked
together. IMPORTANT: the frontend node will act as a DHCP server, so
be sure to isolate the network used for the cluster from other
networks, to avoid conflicts with other DHCP servers. If you start
handing out IP addresses to your co-workers' computers, they may
become annoyed.&nbsp; If the frontend node has multiple network
interfaces, you can use one to connect to the cluster and another to
connect to the Internet.<BR><BR>Put the USB flash or DVD in the
computer that will be the frontend, and turn it on. Make sure the
BIOS setup lets you boot from USB flash or DVD. When you boot up,
you'll see something like the following image:</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="1.png" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=650 HEIGHT=559 BORDER=1></FONT></P>

machine use UEFI mode, search Google for how to switch to Legacy mode
in Bios).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Here, if you
press &lt;Tab&gt;, you have the opportunity to enter options to set
keyboard mappings, or special &quot;cheatcodes&quot; to make the CD
boot on problematic hardware. For example, default locale and
keyboard layout are en_US.UTF-8 and us, respectively, i can get a
Spanish keyboard by pressing &lt;Tab&gt; and then using arrow keys on
keyboard to move the cursor and change keyboard layout to ‚Äúes‚Äù
(Valid options for these can be found in <A HREF="./base.lst.pdf">base.lst.pdf</A>).
Either explore the options by highlighting the Help line and pressing
&lt;Enter&gt;, or edit options by pressing &lt;Tab&gt;, or just press
&lt;Enter&gt; to boot up using default settings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="1.b.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=650 HEIGHT=559 BORDER=1><BR><BR>Once
you boot up, eventually you see:<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="1.1.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=720 HEIGHT=451 BORDER=1><BR></FONT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">This screen gives you the opportunity to use
a permanent storage device for the /home directory of the PelicanHPC
user. By default, if you just press &lt;Enter&gt;, hard disks are not
used, and PelicanHPC does not alter any of the computers used in the
cluster. This is safe and easy, but it has the disadvantage that any
work you do disappears when you shut down the cluster. To use
permanent storage, you can type in the name of a device (hard disk
partition, USB drive, etc.) that has a formatted ext2 or ext3
partition, which will be mounted at /home. For example, you could
replace &quot;ram1&quot; with &quot;sda2&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;hdb5&quot;
(no quotes). If you do this, a directory &quot;user&quot; will be
created at the root of the specified device, and will be used as the
home directory of the cluster user (username &quot;user&quot;). If
you shut down the cluster, the directory will not be removed, and it
can be re-used when you restart PelicanHPC. If you have any doubts
about this, just press &lt;Enter&gt;. For casual experimentation, you
do not need this feature. This feature is provided as a convenience
for advanced users. It is impossible to test this feature on all
possible hardware configurations, so NO GUARANTEES ARE MADE THAT IT
WILL NOT DESTROY YOUR HARD DISK. Back up your data before trying
anything but the default.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">IMPORTANT NOTE: there is another way to use
permanent storage that is quite flexible. This is documented in the
file /home/user/pelican_config, which you can see if you boot using
the default. If this is your first experience with PelicanHPC, I
recommend doing a default boot, study pelican_config, and then choose
the option for permanent storage that you find most
appropriate.<BR><BR>Next, you will see<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="1.2.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=730 HEIGHT=479 BORDER=1></FONT></P>

you are prompted to change the default password:<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="1.3.png" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=730 HEIGHT=479 BORDER=1><BR></FONT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">You should backspace to remove the default

&quot;user&quot; on the frontend node and on all of the compute
nodes, too.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Finally, you are
all booted up and the login prompt appears:<BR><IMG SRC="1.3.1.png" NAME="graphics20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=730 HEIGHT=479 BORDER=0></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Note that you can
enter the Xfce graphical enterface if you choose to by typing
&quot;startx&quot;. By default, PelicanHPC uses the console, just to
avoid possible problems with unusual graphics hardware.<BR><BR>To set
up a cluster, type &quot;pelican_setup&quot;. You can do this from
the console as in these instructions, or from Xfce by opening up a
terminal. Next, we see the following, supposing that you have more

you choose the net device, services need to be started. Please read
the warning in the following screenshot. Setting up a PelicanHPC dhcp
server will get you in trouble with your network administrators if
you do this on an open network. You should make sure that the network
device used for the cluster is isolated from all networks except the
cluster. When you see the following screen, choose &quot;yes&quot;.<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="1.4.png" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=686 HEIGHT=513 BORDER=1><BR><BR><BR>Next

Some other tips:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">you can add
	software to the frontend node using &quot;apt-get install whatever&quot;,
	supposing that the frontend has a second net card that you have
	configured to enable Internet access. This software is not available
	on the compute nodes. To add software so that it is available to all
	the nodes, it should be installed somewhere in /home/user.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">the default
	MPI setup is in the file /home/user/tmp/bhosts. This assigns ranks
	to hosts in a round robin fashion. If your hosts have different
	speeds, numbers of cores, etc., you should modify this file. If the
	frontend node is virtual but the compute nodes are real, you should
	probably remove the frontend node from the calculations.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">if you need
	other packages, then you can make your own version pretty easily
	using the make_pelican script that is available on the PelicanHPC

	&quot;pelican_restarthpc&quot;.</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>IMPORTANT: </B>In the /home/user
directory is the file pelican_config. This file contains switches for
advanced options that allow features such as use of permanent
storage, booting without user intervention, changing the network of
the cluster, wake-on-LAN, etc. Casual users do not need to explore
this, but people who want a permanent cluster should look at it. It
is self-documented.</FONT></P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Saving_your_work"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">Saving
your work</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">By default, PelicanHPC images put /home/user
on a ramdisk which disappears when you shut down. You need to save
your work between sessions, if you want to re-use it. There are many
options, such as mounting a hard disk, using a USB device, etc. If
you have an Internet connection configured, you can email it to
yourself.<BR><BR>If you use PelicanHPC for serious work, it is very
convenient to mount a storage device to use as /home, so that your
work will be saved between sessions without taking any special steps.
When you boot up the frontend node, you have the option to select a
storage device to use. This is a feature for advanced users, and I
strongly advise that you dedicate a hard disk partition for use with
PelicanHPC. If you use a partition with other data on it, you should
make sure to back it up before using it with PelicanHPC! Only ext2,
ext3 and ext4 formats are known to work. This feature has been tested
using a very limited set of hardware, so use it with caution. There
is also the option to automatically mount a volume that has a special
name. See pelican_config in /home/user. This is the best solution for
users who want to use PelicanHPC on a long term basis.<BR><A HREF="#Contents"><BR>Return

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="make_pelican"></A><FONT COLOR="#000000">Using
the make_pelican script</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The distributed ISO images provide a bare
bones cluster setup system, plus some packages that I use in my
research and teaching. There are a few examples taken from my work,
which may be of interest to those learning the basics of MPI, or to
people interested in econometrics. However, many users will find that
Pelican does not contain packages that they need. If one uses
pelican_config properly, it is possible to give all nodes of the
cluster internet access through the connection of the frontend node,
so packages can be simply added using &quot;apt-get&quot;.
Nevertheless, some users will prefer to have a custom version of&nbsp;
the CD image. PelicanHPC is made by running a single script
&quot;make_pelican&quot; (with a version number appended), which is
available on the <A HREF="http://www.pelicanhpc.org/download.html">download
page</A>, and also on the released images. If you have the
prerequisites for running the script, it is very easy to make a
customized version of Pelican. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>The
prerequisites are installed on PelicanHPC, so you can build a custom
version using the released version.</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
The prerequisites are:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">an installed
	version of GNU/Linux. This can be a minimal installation in a chroot
	jail or a virtual machine running under Linux, Windows or MacOS. If
