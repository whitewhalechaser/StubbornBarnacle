An attempt to revive the PelicanHPC project, or at least continue developing from where it left off

Current efforts are towards setting up a permanent server, with all the  workers netbooting off the server into a live enviroment. In the original PelicanHPC project the server was also live-booted, however I have found  it convient to set up a permanent server
